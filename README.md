# book-list
pull a book list from a json file, use react components

## Title of the project
React Components

## Description of the project
Index.html loads react components that load books from a JSON file 
Uses a bootstrap grid layout to have the text description on left for each book and image on the right (sample placeholder for now)

## How to Run
Load index.html in a browser, with the other files in same dir as index.html

## Roadmap of future improvements
* I need to have the pictures have a unique key (right now same as book text details)
* Put in the actual book images
* Make the titles live links using the URLs in the JSON file
